  Our project is an interactive coding tool designed to help users solve Squad 
  Building Challenges (SBCs) for EA FC 25, the latest installment in EA Sports' 
  football video game series. SBCs require players to construct squads that meet 
  specific requirements—like using players from certain nations, leagues, or 
  clubs—while also managing chemistry rules and budget limits. Our tool leverages 
  a database of EA FC 25 soccer players and enables users to input filters that 
  automate and optimize solutions for these challenges. By combining algorithmic 
  techniques with football strategy, users can efficiently and optimally solve 
  difficult SBCs. Additionally, the tool provides a robust player search feature, 
  allowing users to explore the player database with advanced filters to enhance 
  their overall EA FC 25 experience.
